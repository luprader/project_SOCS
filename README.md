This repository contains the LaTeX files to build the project report "Characterizing Shortest-Path Ensembles for Brain Network Modeling Using Empirical Constraints".

The project was part of the master course "Simulation Of Complex Systems" at Chalmers University of Technology.

The source code of the project is in the submodule `project_SOCS_code`.
