Understanding how anatomical pathways manage the flow of information in the human brain remains a fundamental challenge in (network) neuroscience. Parametric models, particularly the Shortest Path Ensembles (SPE), provide a framework for simulating communication between different regions of interest (ROIs) not only through the shortest route, but also through a set of alternatives (near-shortest paths) based on model parameters. The number and relative weighing of these near-shortest paths that would best approximate empirical results remain unknown. Conceptually, a small number of allowed paths captures the biological intuition that brain communication makes use of structural information to use optimal routing, while a large number of allowed paths describes a transmission without the use of any encoded structural information. Using structural connectomes and then simulating signal outputs over time, this report addresses this question by varying the number of paths considered to determine which range minimizes discrepancies between empirical data (connectomes and functional MRIs) and simulated results.

Understanding how information propagates between brain regions is a central challenge in neuroscience. Structural connectivity, as mapped through Diffusion MRI, encodes the pathways that information can flow through when propagating from node to node. Multiple studies have shown that the strength and structure of white-matter routes are tightly linked to functional coupling along the cortex \cite{white_matter}. Network neuroscience offers a quantitative framework for studying these connections, using graph approaches to characterize how the brain's topology supports efficient, flexible and metabolically economical communication \cite{book_graph_brain}.

Decades of research have shown that the human connectome is neither random nor uniformly organized. Instead, it exhibits characteristic properties such as small-world topology, combining high local clustering with few long-range connections \cite{small_world_brain_networks}. The network also contains highly connected hub regions, creating a structure supporting long-range communication, essential for efficient information propagation \cite{rich_club_original}\cite{rich_club_2}. These architectural principles indicate that the connectome is optimized for dynamic information transfer, while operating under biological constraints, such as wiring cost and metabolic efficiency.

Against this structural background, an important challenge is to determine how information flows through the network; that is, from the brain's anatomical structure, determine how brain nodes are functionally correlated. Communication dynamics have been proposed as the missing link between structural and functional connectivity, providing mechanisms of how neural systems coordinate across spatially separated regions \cite{kshortest_original}. Classical frameworks often assume either optimal routing, where signals follow the most efficient path; or diffusive dynamics, where information flows stochastically according to local connectivity. Particularly, random walk processes have been deeply explored, and serve as intuitive models for diffusion-like communication in neural systems \cite{random_walk}.

However, both extremes capture only certain aspects of real neural communication. Empirical work shows that even though information flow in the human brain can be properly studied through network-modelling, neither the shortest-path nor diffusion-like processes returned the best predictions for resting-state functional connectivity \cite{empirical_network}. More recent studies propose that communication may operate along a continuum of routing strategies, where moderate global topological information can already increase efficiency noticeably without requiring full shortest-path optimization \cite{kshortest_original}.

Despite these insights, major gaps remain. In particular, there is no consensus over how many near-shortest paths are used for a signal to travel between Regions Of Interest (ROIs). Seeking to answer these questions, in this study we investigate information transfer using a parametric model to capture the parameter value regime for which results most accurately reflect empirical patterns of brain activity.





%Despite these insights, major gaps remain. In particular, it is not yet clear how many near-shortest paths, or what weighting of such paths, most accurately reflects empirical patterns of brain activity. Real neural communication likely balances efficiency with redundancy, robustness, and limited knowledge about the global network structure. This motivates the use of parametric models, which enable systematic exploration of different communication regimes by varying key parameters. 

% In this study, we investigate information transfer using the Shortest Path Ensembles (SPE) model, a parametric framework that allows signals to traverse not only the shortest path between two regions but also a set of near-shortest alternatives. By continuously varying the number of allowed paths, the model spans communication regimes ranging from highly informed, efficient routing to minimally informed, diffuse propagation. Using structural connectomes and simulated time-resolved signal propagation, we examine which ranges of the SPE parameter best approximate empirical functional connectivity patterns derived from fMRI. Through this approach, we aim to clarify how the brain may flexibly combine efficiency and redundancy to support large-scale information flow.

% With the goal of exploring the relation of structural connections between brain regions to functional correlations in brain activity,%

Connectome data can be used to simulate brain activity using a range of Brain Network Communication Models (BNCMs) \cite{review_methods}\cite{small_world_brain_networks}. On one hand, models based on routing protocol assume that the network operates with a substantial amount of information about its structure, and communications thus mainly occur through the most efficient (shortest) paths \cite{review_brain_structure_and_function}\cite{book_graph_brain}. Alternatively, diffusion models assume that information propagates through the brain without any use of structural information, taking more inefficient paths with higher metabolic cost \cite{random_walk}. 

Parametric models are located between these extremes, using rules that balance the amount of topological information used for propagation and the metabolic cost of transmissions. Examples of this type of framework include linear threshold models \cite{linear_threshold}, biased random walks \cite{biased_random_walk} and shortest path ensembles \cite{kshortest_original}. A common property among them is their ability to be tuned via a parameter, measuring how far the model should lean towards diffusion-type models or routing protocol approaches.

{\bf Method 1 (Linear threshold models).} 
In this approach, signal propagation is determined by the number of neighbouring nodes that have already received the signal \cite{linear_threshold} . Each node in the network will receive the information only if $n$ (or more) of its neighbours had previously received the transmission, making $n$ the tunable parameter of the model. With $n=1$, each node with at least one activated neighbour will receive the signal, resulting in maximal diffusion through broadcasting. Increasing $n$, the conditions for activation become progressively stricter, reducing the propagation along the network. For $n$ sufficiently large, information flow can reach a bottleneck, reflecting a regime in which only tightly clustered neighbourhoods can sustain transmission.




%{ \it In this approach, signals are transmitted based on the number of neighbours $n$ that have received a signal already. The number necessary for a signal to be transmitted is the parameter that can be varied in this model. If $n=0$ the system resembles free broadcasting diffusion through the system, every node propagates the signal to its neighbours. With higher values the range of reachable nodes decreases until it becomes very localised for large values of $n$.}

{\bf Method 2 (Biased random walks).} 
In unbiased random walks, the probability of a signal propagating from node $i$ to node $j$ is proportional to the connection weight between these nodes. Alternatively, in biased random walks, transition probabilities are influenced by the amount of global topological information available to individual nodes; which is controlled by the tunable parameter $\lambda$ \cite{review_methods}\cite{biased_random_walk}. With $\lambda=0$, unbiased random walks are recovered, since individual nodes will only posses information regarding their own connections \cite{random_walk}. In contrast, for $\lambda \to \infty$, the biased random walk converges to the shortest path, since each transmission between every two nodes will contain the entire global topological information, leading to optimal paths \cite{book_graph_brain}.


%In this framework, the transmissions are modelled as random walks with transition probabilities between nodes being biased depending on the topological properties, i.e. their distance to the shortest path considering a specific target node. Depending on the amount of information used to bias the transition, the result will resemble that of a purely random walk or a shortest path trajectory.


{\bf Method 3 (Shortest path ensembles).} \cite{book_graph_brain}\cite{kshortest_original} 
This final parametric model considers that signals between two brain regions do not only travel along the most efficient route, but through the $k$ most efficient paths. Standard shortest-path routing is recovered setting $k=1$. Unlike other models, the shortest path ensembles still preserves selectivity, focusing on the most efficient routes. Small values of $k$, would require extensive global topological knowledge of the network, while larger values of $k$ would relax these conditions, resulting in fewer information cost. Therefore, the parameter $k$ balances the balances the communication delay with informational demands. 

Missing: Why are we going to use SPE instead of the other ones.





%; while considering more possible paths (larger $k$), allows a more realistic way of modelling information transmission in the human brain.



%Instead of only using the shortest path to some target node, one can consider all k-shortest paths, which are the ones most closely resembling the optimal path. The number $k$ of considered paths determines if the system more closely resembles that of shortest path routing or random walk paths.

    \caption{{\bf Workflow} This figure presents the procedure followed to measure the correlation between the empirical data and the simulated results. Since the idea behind this process is to analyze if, from the structure of the brain, its functional processing can be predicted; the following procedure is followed. From structural measurements studying the amount of white and gray matter in the brain, the structural matrix is first obtained. From this structural matrix, which measures how connected any two brain regions are, the distance matrix can be obtained making use of the shortest-path ensemble (SPE) model. The distance matrix measures how much a signal will travel if it flows from one node to another. Finally, making use of the distance matrix and the Kuramoto model, the simulated functional matrix is obtained. 
    On the other hand, studying the neural dynamics of the brain (time series), the empirical functional matrix is obtained. This matrix measures how functionally correlated any two neurons are (how connected is the activation of one brain region to another brain region's spike). 
    Lastly, the simulated functional matrix is compared to the empirical one, to measure how correlated these two are, obtaining one value: the Pearson correlation.
    This procedure will be followed for each patient and for multiple possible values of $k$, trying to measure which $k$ value gives the best results for each patient.

\noindent
To investigate how information propagates between brain regions, a parametric communication model offers a flexible approach. By tuning a model parameter and observing how the resulting simulations align with empirical data, we can detect the range of parameter values that best reproduces real behavior; and therefore, determine which communication regime is closer to the human brain's dynamics.
Starting from the brain's structural connectivity, we simulate information transmission following the selected model and then compare the simulated outcomes with empirical observations using multiple metrics. Trying to capture a broad variety of communication behaviours, we selected the shortest-path ensemble model as our brain network communication model. 

%In order to study a wide range of behaviour with one model, the use of a parametric model was chosen as the brain network communication model. In particular, it was decided to use the shortest path ensemble approach. Several metrics will be used to characterize the behaviour of this communication method.
{\bf Shortest path ensembles (SPE).} {

{\color{red} we use k distance metric mainly, so maybe rename to k distance, explain interpretation and motivation in detail.}

This model proposes that a signal propagating from one region to another, can only do so through one of the \textit{k} shortest paths (ensemble) \cite{kshortest_original}. Following the SPE model, each route $i$ will be assigned a probability $P_i$ of the signal communicating through it according to its connection-distance length $d_i$ \cite{kprobabilities}. To assign higher probabilities to shorter routes, probabilities will be defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
    P_i=\frac{1/d_i}{\sum_{i=1}^k (1/d_i)}
    \label{probabilities_eq}
\end{equation}

With $d_i=-\log \left( \sum_jw_{j\to j+1}\right)$, where $w_{j\to j+1} \in (0,1)$ indicates the connection degree between the node $j$ and the next node $j+1$; nodes that belong to the path $i$ (possibly) traveled by the signal \cite{kshortest_original}.

This parametric model allows an analysis dependent on the size of the ensemble. Modifying the number of shortest paths considered, \textit{k}, the metrics presented afterwards will be studied, in order to find the range of \textit{k}-values for which the empirical results are most faithfully reproduced. 

While other processes generally present high energy or information costs, SPE not only preserves low delay costs, but also prevents other costs from rising.
In addition, SPE allows to compare the presence and impact of time delay by comparing paths within the ensemble to each other, making it possible to explore the structural properties which shape the propagation of signals in the proximity of efficient (shortest path) and inefficient (detour) communication routes.

[Discuss the use case scenarios of the method, their features with advantages and disadvantages / strong and weak points, and whether it is more or less suitable for the research question. It is a good idea to reference the literature.]} 

{\bf Functional Correlation (FC).} {In brain-network modelling, this procedure is commonly used to measures the correlation structure of activity time series across brain regions, generally using an FC matrix \cite{general_methods}. Where each element of the matrix is the Pearson correlation coefficient between the time series of two brain regions. With this metric, an exhaustive comparison between empirical outcomes and simulated results will be performed. Although this measure does not cover all the characteristics of a brain's network, it works as a general reference for different ROIs' correlation.

{\bf Kuramoto Model (KM).} {This is a mathematical framework commonly used to describe collective synchronization in populations of coupled oscillators with varied natural frequencies. Considering each brain region as an oscillator, the coupling between nodes is justified by the brain connections (grey matter), allowing the usage of the Kuramoto model for brain-signal communication \cite{kuramoto-eq}. Defining $\theta(t)$ as the phase (frequency) of node $n$ at time $t$, the following equation is satisfied:}

\begin{equation}
    \frac{d \theta_n}{dt} = \omega_n + c\cdot \sum_{p=1}^{N} C_{np}\cdot \sin{ \left(\theta_p (t-\tau_{np}) -\theta_n(t)\right)} + \xi\cdot\eta_n(t)
\end{equation}

Where $n$ represents the node index: $n=1,...,N$. The term $\omega_n$ represents the intrinsic angular frequency, satisfying $\omega_n=2\pi \nu_n$, where $\nu_n$ represents a fixed Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(60Hz, \sigma_f^2)$. $C_{np}$ is the relative coupling strength from node $p$ to node $n$, and $\xi$ is the global coupling scale, which scales all connection strengths. The delay between node $p$'s information emission, and node $n$'s reception is measured through $\tau_{np}$, which depends on the distance between the nodes. Defining $L_{np}$ as the distance matrix, and the average distance between nodes as $\langle L\rangle$, $k$; the delay is defined as $\tau_{np}=\langle \tau_{np}\rangle L_{np} /\langle L\rangle$; where $\langle \tau \rangle =11$ms. Lastly, $\xi$ represents the noise factor, accompanied by the term $\eta_n(t)$, indicating the noise received by local networks, corresponding to uncorrelated Gaussian white noise with zero mean, and $\sigma^2=x$. Since this study studies the effect of considering different $k$ shortest paths to define the functional correlation between brain regions, the coupling matrix $C$ and the distance matrix $L$ will be dependent on $k$. Reasonably, $C_{np}=1/L_{np}$ $\forall n,p$, since the further apart two nodes are from each other, the less coupled they will be \cite{kuramoto-eq}. 

{\color{red} Maybe I will add "BOLD" conversion, this is converting the kuramoto output to the signal that is actually measured by the fMRI using Baloon-Windkessel method, I have some code for that but not sure if it will work}


% We could say the good and bad parts after describing the methods.



[Discuss the use case scenarios of the method, their features with advantages and disadvantages / strong and weak points, and whether it is more or less suitable for the research question. It is a good idea to reference the literature]

%{\bf Recurrent Quantification Analysis (RQA).} {With fMRIs in the form of time series, one can perform analyses on the recurrence of temporal patterns between ROIs. Recurrence plots and information theoretic measures can be used to compare different time series with each other \cite{webber2015recurrence} and will be used to compare simulated results with empirical data. These tools usually require domain specific knowledge in order to find good parameter values for the analysis.}

%{\bf Shannon Entropy Growth Curve.} {The Shannon entropy growth curve for a time series of states of a dynamical systems can be used to understand the temporal order of complexity of a system, showing the exact orders of time relevant to the behaviour of the system \cite{crutchfield2003regularities}. It calculates the block entropies for a time series and looks at changes in the growth behaviour. It has been used in applications related to Reinforcement Learning and general state estimation in Markov Processes. The possible estimation length of the growth curve depends highly on the system and the number of samples, since a naive maximum likelihood estimation is biased to underestimate the entropy.}

I could also make additional histograms below, showing the distribution of the distance values for the selected k

second result will be the correlation graph of k-distances vs FC, here we talk about the structure of the graph, we can also add the histogram as a panel as discussed with yu-wei, there we will motivate that we mainly look at the structure up to 10 in detail

the next one will be how i decided on the parameters that differ from the paper, ill probably have some graph that shows the 1 dimensional sweep or sth

then we can show again for k= 1 25 50 the resulting FC matrices (averaged) from kuramoto with the empirical averages below to compare visually, we can talk about structures that are captured etc.

lastly there will be the plot of the FCvs empirical along k, hopefully matching the other graph in its structure, I will probably now simulater all k, but 1-10 + 20, 30, 40, 50 with errorbars, since that will take long enough already
}

The current simulations using the parameters proposed in \cite{kuramoto-eq} do not produce FC matrices that have significant pearson correlation to the empirical FC matrices \ref{fig:res2}. The highest correlation value achieved right now is 0.018, which is about  a factor 10 smaller than what would be acceptable going off of the base correlation that the k-distance matrices have right now \ref{fig:res1}.

It can be seen that the obtained correlations between simulated FC and empirical FC are also not following any structure in parameter space right now. Results are essentially random noise right now.

Trying to analyze if the correlation between empirical and simulated results has a clear dependency on the coupling parameter $c$, the noise factor $\xi$, or in $k$, a projection over these axes was performed (center left, center right, and right panels, respectively). The behavior exhibited by the projections, with close averages and high variances, demonstrates that the correlation cannot be easily simplified to the value of one of these parameters, but rather depends highly on the set $(c,n,k)$.

{\color{red} k distance always is the weighted value of all paths up to k, but maybe one should also just look at other combinations of paths, maybe k3 is not used but 4 and 6 etc. this is a limitation of what we did

kuramoto is a simplification, and we will not have simulated for the same timescales as the empirical measurements, this may be a problem with comparability, though I did ensure that the oscillators had stabilized within the time frame that i simulated

also in actuality we should convert the data that we get to BOLD signal, I have some code from a guy that supposedly does this, maybe i can still add that.}

The optimal parameters curently obtained for the model vary strongly depending on the k-distance matrix used, but they are mostly in the same order of magnitude as the ones proposed in \cite{kuramoto-eq}.

Further investigation will be conducted to see if the model can be improved to obtain statistically significant results.

The base correlation of the k-distance matrices against empirical FC is interesting due to the suggested additional importance of paths with length $\approx$ 5 in addition to shortest path signalling, which has the highest correlation.
